  U-he Skins
</h1>

[u-he](https://u-he.com/) create cross platform virtual synthesizers and
audio effects. They also provide a [page](https://u-he.com/PatchLib/skins.html)
listing various skins that are available to download and use on their products. The page is a little outdated, and it can be hard to find skins for a particular device.

This repository contains the source code for a React application which consumes the data from the linked u-he page and displays it in a more modern and user-friendly way.

### UI Hosting

This application is hosted using Github Pages and can be found at:

https://devklick.github.io/u-he-skins/

### API

This application consumes data returned by the API in another repository, [u-he-skins-api](https://github.com/devklick/u-he-skins-api).
